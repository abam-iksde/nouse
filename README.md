#NOUSE
Nouse is a scripting language and interpreter/virtual machine
written as an exercise. It's not meant to be used in real life
(not in it's current state at least), due to how slow and unreliable
it can be. Hence its name: Nouse - no use.

Despite Nouse's drawbacks, its syntax/structure is still rather interesting.
